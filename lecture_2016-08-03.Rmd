    - Address complexities of data
    - Answer the research question
    
# Data Format

- Assume rectangular data where rows are observations and columns are variables
- Analyzing in Excel, R, etc.

# 1. Missing Data

- Complete case analysis: keep only observations with no missing values across all variables
- Complete variable analysis: keep only variables with no missing values across all observations
- Percent of missingness
- Mean Imputation: fill in missing value with mean of non-missing values
- Multiple Imputation

# 2. Correct Data Structures

- Do you have quantitative and qualitative variables correctly defined in your data?
- Data cleaning is often a tedious yet necessary first step before analysis
- Example: dichotomization

# 3. One or Many
