# 3.1.7 Exercises

1. Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:

    `mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]`  
    `mtcars[-1:4, ]`  
    `mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]`  
    `mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]`  
  
    > 
        
2. Why does `x <- 1:5`; `x[NA]` yield five missing values? (Hint: why is it different from `x[NA_real_]`?)

    >  

3. What does `upper.tri()` return? How does subsetting a matrix with it work? Do we need any additional subsetting rules to describe its behaviour?

    `x <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "*")`  
    `x[upper.tri(x)]`
    
    > 
    
4. Why does `mtcars[1:20]` return a error? How does it differ from the similar `mtcars[1:20, ]`?

    > 

5. Implement your own function that extracts the diagonal en- tries from a matrix (it should behave like `diag(x)` where `x` is a matrix).

    > 

6. What does `df[is.na(df)] <- 0` do? How does it work?

    > 

# 3.2.4 Exercises 

1. Given a linear model, e.g., `mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)`, extract the residual degrees of freedom. Extract the R squared from the model summary (`summary(mod)`)

# 3.4.9 Exercises

1. How would you randomly permute the columns of a data frame? (This is an important technique in random forests.) Can you simultaneously permute the rows and columns in one step?

    > 

2. How would you select a random sample of m rows from a data frame? What if the sample had to be contiguous (i.e., with an initial row, a final row, and every row in between)?

    > 

3. How could you put the columns in a data frame in alphabetical order?
